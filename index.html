<p>Generally speaking, HTML email can be broken down into three categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Marketing</strong>, where a large list of people are sent the same or very similar emails from a source to which they’ve intentionally subscribed (like a newsletter, or product announcement). </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notification</strong>, where an email is sent to a person on an individual basis, usually to be notified each time a particular event happens (like getting a new follower, or reciving a birthday discount).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transactional</strong>, where an email is sent to a person on an individual basis, usually as a result of an action they’ve taken (like receiving purchase confirmation, password change).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Fully understanding each different email type is very important for your strategy. Transactional, notification and marketing messages don't obey to the same rules. In each of these 3 cases, the recipient's position is actually different.</p>

<p>The table below summarizes the situation; note the different equivalent designations. As you can see, the Unsubscribe Link is not required in every case.</p>

<h2>
<a id="marketing-emails" class="anchor" href="#marketing-emails" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Marketing Emails</h2>

<p>Marketing (or Bulk) emails stimulate your clients and leads. They contain informative / incentive messages. The recipient must agree to receive such emails: opt-in is mandatory.</p>

<p>However, the recipient does not make an explicit request for a message in particular. For example: he doesn't subscribe for the "November Newsletter", he rather subscribes to the "Monthly Newsletter".</p>

<p>There can be a periodicity, but the message can also be sent to a segment in particular. Nonetheless, the main point is that messages are sent independently from specific actions from the clients.</p>

<p>With Marketing emails, you don't state: "such clients will receive such message if they perform such action": it would then be a <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeAndEmails/types-of-email/blob/master/README.md#notification-emails">notification email</a>. We would rather state: "such clients will receive such message". The message is neither related to an "event" nor to an action from the recipient.</p>

<ul>
<li>Newsletters</li>
<li>Announcements</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="notification-emails" class="anchor" href="#notification-emails" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notification Emails</h2>

<p>Notification email are also known as trigger, alert or auto-responder. They allow the user to be notified each time a particular event happens (or has happened). More generally, the notification email may be used in order to celebrate and/or mark an event.</p>

<p>It is either the recipients themselves, or the sender that will establish criteria for an outgoing message to be triggered by an event.</p>

<p>From a marketer's point of view, it can be relevant to encourage the targets to opt in to receive notifications about the services being offered. Think of an email such as "Mr. X is now following you on Twitter". This kind of message is more often opened and it motivates the recipient into checking their account.</p>

<p>You may also decide to create notifications by yourself. These will then be related to events occurring after a client's action. The purpose here is to mark a significant event in order to capitalize on it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Birthday email</li>
<li>Shopping Cart Abandonment</li>
<li>Discounts on recently browsed products</li>
<li>Feedback request after a purchase</li>
<li>Congratulations after a status change (first purchase, subscription...)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="transactional-emails" class="anchor" href="#transactional-emails" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transactional Emails</h2>

<p>This is an expected message and its content is information that the client wishes to check or confirm, and not "discover". This type of email is not intended to optimize the customer relationship but to define it and mark it out. It is a point of reference in one’s CRM.</p>

<p>Strong attention should be paid to this kind of email. These emails must be specifically dealt with: wrongly delivered newsletters might impact leads, but an undelivered transactional email will upset the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you need email marketing?</strong></p>

<p>Anybody who is online has an active email address. So when it comes to connecting with your prospects and customers, there’s no channel with a wider reach than email. The inbox is the most personal connection you can have with your audience, and Email Marketing maximizes the effectiveness of that connection.</p>
